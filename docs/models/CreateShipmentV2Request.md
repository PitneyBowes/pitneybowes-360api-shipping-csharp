**RateShopBy** | **string** | RateShop, which is attached to an Enterprise or Location, is done through three approaches: by Carrier, by RateGroup, and by Ruleset. &lt;br /&gt;  Through Carrier, customers can choose the carriers as per requirement, based on which services, parcel types, and special services can be selected, and RateShop is done. &lt;br /&gt; Through RateGroup, customers can select the RateGroup, which has been divided into two categories: Cheapest (w.r.t. price) and Fastest (w.r.t. delivery hours). &lt;br /&gt; Through Ruleset, customers can define the Condition/rule for selecting carriers and their services, so they do not need to worry for Rate Shopping every time they create Shipment. For example, For a particular location, they can set one definite carrier, or apply RateGroup - Cheapest/Fastest. Similarly, for a particular amount like below $1000 Dollars, they can select a definite carrier service, based on RateGroup. |
