      description: "> **Note:** This Request sample includes the full set of supported\
        \ fields across all carriers. However, not all fields are applicable to every\
        \ carrier. When making API calls from the doc portal, ensure you include only\
        \ the parameters supported by the specific carrier you are integrating with.\
        \ If unsupported fields are included, the request may fail. <br/>\nTo simplify\
        \ integration and avoid errors, refer to the [Postman Collection](/docs/resources/postman/).\
        \ <br/>\nTo explore which label types, label formats, label sizes, parcel\
        \ types, services, and special services are supported by each carrier, see\
        \ the [Carrier Catalog](/docs/shipping/carriers/carrier-catalog/). Detailed\
        \ field descriptions are also provided below.\n\nThe Create Shipment API is\
        \ used to create shipments and generate shipment labels. A shipment refers\
        \ to the process of packing and transporting an item from a source location\
        \ to a destination location using a carrier service. The API supports both\
        \ domestic and international shipments.<br>\n\n**Domestic Shipments** <br>\n\
        \n  - Both the `toAddress` and `fromAddress` addresses must be within the\
        \ same country.\n  - Requires carrier services and associated special services.\n\
        \n**International Shipments**\n  - The `toAddress` must be in a different\
        \ country than the `fromAddress`.\n  - Requires international carrier services,\
        \ special services, and customs information.<br>\n\nThe V2 Create Shipment\
        \ API compares shipping rates, services, and options across multiple carriers.\
        \ It selects the best shipping solution based on criteria such as cost, delivery\
        \ speed, or other business rules. This automates decision-making and eliminates\
        \ the need for manual analysis of carrier data. It supports three RateShop\
        \ types: <br>\n\n**1. By Carrier:**<br>\n\n  - Manually specify the carrier\
        \ and service for shipment creation.\n  - Provides more customization than\
        \ V1 Create Shipment.\n\n**2. By RuleSet**<br>\n\n  - Automatically select\
        \ the best carrier and service based on predefined rules (e.g., cheapest,\
        \ fastest). For example: <br>\n  - Shipments weighing up to 3kg use a \"Standard\"\
        \ service type with carrier A.\n  - Shipments exceeding 3kg use an \"Over-weight\"\
        \ service type with carrier B.\n  - Rules are fully client-defined, allowing\
        \ for dynamic decision-making based on shipment parameters like weight, dimensions,\
        \ and destination.\n\n**3. By RateGroup**<br>\n\n  - Use predefined rate groups\
        \ to select a carrier and service dynamically.For example:<br>\n  - Clients\
        \ can choose between the fastest delivery or the cheapest service rate among\
        \ a predefined group of carriers.\n  - The system automatically determines\
        \ and selects the best carrier and service, without the need for manual comparisons.\n\
        \  \n**Notes**<br>\n\n  - The `rateShopBy` field determines the variant to\
        \ use (`carrier`, `ruleset`, or `rategroup`).\n  - Ensure that variant-specific\
        \ fields are correctly populated:\n    - **byCarrier:** `carrierAccountId`,\
        \ `carrier`, and `service`\n    - **byRuleSet:** `ruleType` and `shipOption`\n\
        \    - **byRateGroup:** `ruleType` and `rateGroupId`\n\n  - Define special\
        \ services in one of two ways - by using a `specialServiceId` or by specifying\
        \  special service objects such as `deliveryConfirmation`, `handling`, `insurance`,\
        \ or `returnOptions`. These two cannot be used together in the same request.\n"

      description: "Electronic Trade Documents Upload API is an international shipping\
        \ document upload solution that simplifies global shipping needs and allows\

        \ shipments. \nYou can submit most of your trade documents electronically\
        \ relieving yourself from printing or attaching trade documents with the shipment.\
        \ <br/>\nThis API simplifies and accelerates customs clearance by replacing\
        \ physical paperwork with electronic documentation.<br/>\nThe customs and\
        \ other agencies receive electronically sent documents faster than paper copies\
        \ attached with your shipment. The customs clearance process is also optimized\
        \ as capturing and sharing of critical trade information is done at earlier\
        \ stages of shipping.\n\n> Note:\n- FedEx supports ETD with the special service\
        \ `ELECTRONIC_TRADE_DOCUMENTS`.\n- DHL Express supports ETD with the special\
        \ service `PAPERLESS`.\n- In certain scenarios, the originals of specific\
        \ international documents still need to be attached to the package. \n- For\
        \ smooth customs clearance and to avoid delays, ensure that the documents\
        \ are visually clear and not distorted in any way.\n\n**How the Workflow Operates**<br/>\n\
        \n**Step 1: Submit Electronic Trade Document Metadata**<br/>\n\nInitiate the\
        \ process by making a POST request to the ETD Upload API with the document\
        \ metadata (e.g., file name, document type, and content type).<br/>\nIn response,\
        \ the system returns:<br/>\n- A pre-signed S3 upload URL (url)<br/>\n- A fileName<br/>\n\
        - A relative `s3FileId` used to reference the uploaded document later<br/>\n\
        \n**Step 2: Upload the Document File**<br/>\n\nAfter receiving the response,\
        \ you must perform a separate HTTP PUT request to the provided [url](https://docs.shipping360.pitneybowes.com/openapi/shipping/operation/uploadETD/#!c=200&path=url&t=response).<br/>\n\
        \n- This request must upload the binary content of the file (e.g., PDF or\
        \ image)<br/>\n\n- Upload the same file whose metadata was submitted in step-1\
        \ <br/>\n\n**Step 3: Reference the Document in Shipment Creation**<br/>\n\n\
        Once the ETD uploaded successfully, the document is stored in the S3 bucket.<br/>\n\
        \n- Once uploaded, the document is stored in the S3 bucket and can later be\
        \ referenced via the `s3FileId` in [Create International Shipment API](https://docs.shipping360.pitneybowes.com/openapi/shipping/operation/createShipment/#!path=1/customs/customsDocuments&t=request)\

        **Key Considerations**:<br>

           - This operation is applicable only if the original shipment was successfully created. It cannot be used if the initial Create Shipment request resulted in no response or encountered an error.
           - USPS allows only 1 reprint.

           - All other carriers allow up to 8 reprints.
           - Reprints are valid for 24 hours from the time the label was first created.
           - Reprinting should only be used when necessary. Excessive reprint attempts are restricted and monitored.

        This operation cancels or voids a shipment label that has not been processed by the carrier. When you cancel an unused prepaid shipment label, the API initiates a request for an electronic refund.<br>

        **Key Considerations**
        - Cancelation must occur before the shipment is picked up or processed by the carrier.
        - Refunds are only applicable for unused labels. Voiding a used label may result in penalties or billing.<br>
        - **USPS**:
           - Cancel unused USPS prepaid labels within 30 days of printing to start the refund process.
           - Refund requests are processed within 14 business days from the date the refund was requested, provided the label has not been used.
           - Approved refunds are automatically credited to the account you used to pay for the label.
           - **Note**: USPS considers it a federal offense to induct a label that has already been refunded.
           - **Note**: Refunds are not available for First-Class Mail letters and flats.
           - **Note**: Refunds are subject to the policies of the applicable carrier.
        - For unused post-paid labels, you must void them. Voiding avoids billing for the label and allows the carrier to maintain an accurate count for pickups.
        - Always destroy voided labels to prevent accidental use. If a voided label is shipped, you will be billed for the label.
        - Once a refund has been claimed, you cannot use the shipping label for sending packages. It will be rejected.

        **What is Proof of Delivery (POD)?**<br>
        Proof of Delivery is a document or file that acts as evidence of successful shipment delivery. This file contains a digital copy of the recipient's signature, provided as a downloadable link or URL.

        **Key Considerations:**
        - It provides the recipient's signature image captured at the time of delivery as proof that the shipment was successfully delivered.
        - The API provides the recipient's signature image as Proof of Delivery (POD) to confirm successful shipment delivery.
        - A request requires the mandatory `shipmentId`.
        - If a signature is captured by the carrier, the API returns it as a downloadable link of the PDF in the `signatureFileURL` field.
        - The `signatureFileURL` provided in the API response expires after 60 minutes.
        - If no signature is available, the API returns an error.
        - Signature Image ERR is supported for USPS carrier only.

        **UPS Billing Rules:**<br/>
         - When only sender or only receiver is specified as the payer, the same account number must be used for both TRANSPORTATION_CHARGES and duties/taxes.
         - If no bill-to party (who will pay for TRANSPORTATION_CHARGES or duties and taxes) is explicitly defined, UPS will default billing to the sender/shipper.
         - In the case of DDU (Delivery Duty Unpaid) and no bill-to party provided:
           - Pitney Bowes does not prompt for BILL_PARTY.
           - UPS attempts to collect duties and taxes in the destination country via its billing team or the ICOD (Import Collect on Delivery) process.
           - In cases where UPS is unable to collect these charges, the sender (in the origin country) will be billed as a fallback.
         - Third Party can be assigned to pay TRANSPORTATION_CHARGES charges only. Duties and taxes cannot be billed to a third party.
         - The ALL_CHARGES billing type is not supported by UPS. Charges must be split explicitly between TRANSPORTATION_CHARGES and DUTIES_AND_TAXES.
